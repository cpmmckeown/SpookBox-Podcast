  This is the website of horror movie podcast SpookBox. We're a Podcast run by three friends from the UK. We chat about horror movies but also all things 'Spooky' to try and shed some light on otherwise dark subjects. We try to have a good time while talking but also like to bring in some academic sources while we're at it when we remember!
