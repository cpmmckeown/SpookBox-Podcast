description: "Welcome Spookboxers! We have two bits of spooky news for you today. This is the first episode coming to you on a MONDAY, as of our new schedule. That’s right, you’ll be able to access our latest on a MONDAY now, because we realised life is just one big weekend. So definitely like and subscribe to get the ‘tent straight to you as it's made. Another update is we’re now on itunes if that’s your thing, so search for ‘Spookbox Podcast’ on there and enjoy some ad-free listening. 

This episode is sponsored by the 2009 financial crisis. Thanks to deregulation in the financial industry we're out here making art. Don’t let your parents tell you you won’t become something. 

This week, Conor, Daf and I are three housemates talking about Blood Quantum, a 2019 Canadian zombie horror film that takes place on a First Nations reserve. The film is super interesting not only because its title refers to the blood quantum laws in the United States, which have been used to determine indigeneity based on the percentage of one's indigenous ancestry. If you want to learn more about blood-quantum laws as both a federal government-enforced restriction on rights and their maintenance by First Nation Tribes for tribal citizenship and culture, check out the NPR episode on it which we’ll link in the description.

The film explores a strain of zombie apocalypse that infects those of non-indiginous blood. In effect, this exercises a super interesting commentary on colonialism by putting a sardonic twist on the history of white European settlers  bringing diseases they had developed immunity to to First Nations persons. We felt the film-making ran into some problems mastering its premise. Namely the mixing of varying filmmaking styles, emotional tones, and the unreliability of the dialogue. Perhaps requiring something this sociopolitically biting to also be super cohesive in execution is too big of an ask. Through delving into some interviews with Mi’gmaq First Nations director Jeff Barnaby, I learned that George Romero was a big influence on him, and that his goal with this film was to indigenize the popular cinematic trope of zombies.  I think that has definitely been achieved. At its very least this is a B-movie with a steady anarchist heartbeat."
