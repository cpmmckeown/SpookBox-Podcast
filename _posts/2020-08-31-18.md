summary: "SpookBox retrospective on Salad Fingers... It predicted Brexit."
description: "This week we look at an internet classic! The first eleven episodes of David Firth's 2005-2019 'Salad Fingers' shorts. Although originally an Adobe Flash animation, the show has spawned - arguably - numerous progeny from The Mighty Boosh to elements of Rick and Morty. In this episode we make the case for a reading of the series that confronts the farcical nature of British colonial jingoism in a post-empire era, with Salad Fingers the character seeming to represent all the worst parts of British colonialism in post-modernity."
