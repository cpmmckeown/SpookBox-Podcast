summary: "This week the SpookBox crew dive into Richard Stanley's Color Out of Space (2019)"
description: "In our second episode of Spookbox, Heather, Daff and Conor discuss Color Out of Space, Richard Stanley's 2019 psychedelic horror staring Nicholas Cage and Joley Richardson. We loved this movie but talk inevitably veers towards H.P. Lovecraft and the issues surrounding him, along with the usual talking points of cosmic horror, existentialism and the collapse of the nuclear family. Fun times!"
