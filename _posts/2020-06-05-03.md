summary: "This week we excavate deeper meaning from Tyler Cornack's Butt Boy (2019)"
description: "This week Daff hosts a conversation with Heather and Conor about Butt Boy (Tyler Cornack, 2019). The central question seems to be whether this movie is post or possible even meta-modern? From there, we discuss everything from psychoanalysis to Japanese culture in an attempt to pull some type of cohesive reading of this movie out of our butts. "
