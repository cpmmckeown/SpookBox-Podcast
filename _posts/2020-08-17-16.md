description: "This week we’re looking at Friday the 13th, the 1980 movie by Sean S. Cunningham - the man behind this and, pretty much nothing else. 

I think this film is interesting for a few reasons, it was made off the back of the success of John Carpenter’s Halloween the previous year (1979), it was Kevin Bacon’s second film and it was the first independent horror movie to obtain major distribution. 

This week we also have some of the usual chats about theory as well as looking at the text itself. If you're interested, we discuss: 

Marx, K. (1867). Capital: A Critique of Political Economy. Volume I. Book One: The Process of Production of Capital. USSR: Progress Publishers. 

Mulvey, M. (1975). "Visual Pleasure in the Narrative Cinema", Screen 16 (3). "
duration: "63:50"
