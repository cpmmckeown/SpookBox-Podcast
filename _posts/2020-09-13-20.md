summary: "SpookBox move in to Vivarium and the Sisyphean task of modern living"
description: "Welcome Spookboxers to episode 20 of our film podcast dedicated to finding the weird and the eerie in cinema and streaming. If you’re just joining us for the first time the set-up is this; three housemates take it in turns to give our film pick of the week the theory treatment, all while hopelessly failing to conceal our dirtbag anarchist biases.  At the helm today is myself Heather, and I’m joined by Conor - and Daf - to tackle this week’s film. We’re looking at sci-fi psychological horror Vivarium, directed by Lorca Finnegan and co-produced internationally by Ireland, Belgium and Denmark. Conor and I watched this as a preview at a film festival last year. But its wider release this March is definitely more appropriate, given that the film follows a couple of first time home-buyers played by Imogen Poots and Jesse Einberg, taken to a strange, bland housing development by an absurdly bureaucratic estate agent and finding themselves trapped in the labyrinthine suburbs, unable to leave. 2020, am I right? Right lads, what did you think?
